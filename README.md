Once you have cloned the project, to run:
1. Open a terminal and cd into the `server` directory (backend)
   - Run `npm install` to install all necessary modules
   - Run `node index.js` to start the server
2. Open another terminal and cd into the `client` directory (frontend)
   - Run `npm install` to install all necessary modules
   - Run `npm run start` to start the client web application

The above steps should launch the login page on your default browser.
